Similar to developer cards, developers can use Vaunt's API to embed Achievement cards they have earned! The primary goal of achievement cards is to provide a easy way for developers to showcase your more contributions.

Over time, we will be adding more customization for achievement cards. We have initially added support for GitHub and will be evaluating adding other VCS vendors in the future.


# Types of Cards 

Cards are embeddable images that contain various information. We will be adding more and more cards to Vaunt as development continues.
